# L2_LanguageLearnerClassification

Creating an end-to-end classification system using a corpus of HTML documents scraped from the Lang-8 language learning website. In particular, I will be building a classifier to distinguish English text written by Lang-8 users whose native language (L1) is another European language (French and Spanish) from those written by L1 speakers of East Asian languages (Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese).
